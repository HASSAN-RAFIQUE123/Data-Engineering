    "## Python OOP Assignment\n",
    "#### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "OOP is object oriented programming language.One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects.\n",
    "This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).esign the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. \n",
    "The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. \n",
    "#### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses, progressing from \n",
    "left to right (by default). The search stops at the first place the attribute is found\n",
    "#### Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    ".-Instance: instance means just creating a reference(copy).\n",
    ".-object: means when memory location is associated with the object (is a run-time entity of the class) by using the new operator.\n",
    ".-In simple words, Instance refers to the copy of the object at a particular time whereas object refers to the memory address of the class.\n",
    "#### Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "self. it is used to c\n",
    "#### Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?\n",
    "init method is constructor of class which is intilized in the class and for this no need to create object for init.\n",
    "#### Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "class teacher:\n",
    "  def __init__(self,name):\n",
    "      self.name=name\n",
    "      return self.name\n",
    "t=teaher('ali') # instance of class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "class item: # item class name\n",
    "    \"this is class item\"\n",
    "    pass.\n",
    "#### Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "A class from which class inherit call parent or superclass.a class inherid from superclass is called subclass.\n",
    " variables and methods of a class can be reused again in another class through inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Classes in python are templates for creating objects. They contain variables and functions which define the class objects. At the same time, modules are python programs that can be imported into another python program. Importing a \n",
    "module enables the usage of the module’s functions and variables into another program. \n",
    "math module in python contains just a bunch of functions,"

    "Both inheritance and polymorphism are fundamental concepts of object oriented programming. \n",
    "These concepts help us to create code that can be extended and easily maintainable\n",
    "Inheritance mean parent chiled relation. subclass and super class.property of one class used in another chilled class.\n",
    " The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name \n",

    "child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q18. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "exception handling in python.we catch exceptions and handle them using try and except code blocks. The try clause contains the code that can raise an exception, while the except clause contains the code lines that handle the exception. Let's see if we can access the index from the array,\n",
    "which is more than the array's length, and handle the resulting exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q19. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "An exception is an issue (run time error) occurred during the execution of a program. \n",
    "For understanding purpose let us look at it in a different manner.if you don’t handle exceptions\n",
    "When an exception occurred, if you don’t handle it, the program terminates abruptly and the code past the line that caused the exception will not get executed."
